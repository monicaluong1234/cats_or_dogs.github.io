        <p>Title: Cats Vs. Dogs</p>
        <p>Medium: brackets, pictures from instagran, and websites for pros/cons</p>
        <br>
        <p>I started this website by thinking about what topics I enjoyed and what things I would be willing to talk about. I came to the conclusion of writing about cats vs. dogs because I feel like I am bias towards cats. I wanted to see if I could convince myself into liking dogs a bit more. I started with the main site then built out to the extra pages, each page is a different side of the argument to kep it less confusing. In this net_art I am exploring how much photos matter on web pages and the contrast. I think I also want to inform my viewers.</p>
